# Contribution Workflow üè≠

We at Milan believe in industry standards and super organized and clean workflow. Here's how your contributions will be handled.


## How we merge PRs

1. Follow  [PR Guidelines](https://github.com/MilanCommunity/Milan/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-a-pull-request-) to raise a PR. We wait upto a month before considering it inactive/ready for review. Maintainers and contributors both have other works to do too. 

2. Maintainers will review, request changes, and approve the PR accordingly. If changes are requested do click on the `Resolve Conversation` button to let the maintainers know that you have made the changes. Be paitent at all times.

3. Once the PR is approved, a label of https://github.com/MilanCommunity/Milan-Backend/labels/%F0%9F%A5%97%20status%3A%20ready%20for%20merge will be added and the PR will be merged.


## How we publish releases

- Once the changes are merged to `main` branch, a new `draft release` will be created. 
- The release will be published in due time depending upon how important they are.
